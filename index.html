        <h1>HISTSCI 119VH StoryMap Project</h1>

        <p> My project was centered around a reading by James Delbourgo about the history and science of chocolate as related to U.K. physician-botanist Hans Sloane.

        <h2> This is the StoryMap I presented.</h2>
          <iframe src="https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/3879c1a86013af1780b6fa45785bf21e/chocolate-hans-sloane-hs119/index.html" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
        <p> This specific map is a German map from 1854 created by cartographer Joseph Meyer.
          
          
        <p>“What we often think of narrowly as western scientific objects – herbarium specimens, species illustrations, classification systems and ethnographic objects – should be recognized as artifacts of cross-cultural exchange and contest over landscapes, their uses and their histories”

Hans Sloane: Irish-born physician/botanist/naturalst
- President of Royal College of Physicians
- President of Royal Society (1727, right after Newton!)
- 1687-1689: Went to Jamaica, 15 months, acted as physician to the Governor of Jamaica
- 1707, 1725: published 2-volume “Natural History in Jamaica”

Important Contexts Re: Sloane (Economic, Political)
- His activity & processes of collection & production were deeply embedded in the slave trade
    - Already entrenched to travel to Jamaica/West Indies
- Leaves out lots of people/actors and their labor: slaves (W Africans/Jamaicans)
    - Communities of free Africans in Jamaica also
    - Taino & Arawak: Indigenous Caribbeans
- Pragmatic and driven entrepreneur: journey to “improve his knowledge of Caribbean species and discover useful and profitable new drugs”
- Knowledge extraction & exploitations
    - How was knowledge produced & transformed in Jamaica?
- Colonialism!!!!!! Old White Men
- False discovery & exploration
- Places: Center vs. Periphery
    - Europe as center…? All about perspective
- Early ideas of Race Theory

- Cacao vs Milk Chocolate
    - Virtual Witnessing & written text as a scientific observation
    - Illustrations (not drawn by Sloane; Rev. Garrett Moore)
        - The “Cacao” illustration w/ both fresh and dry depictions is part of natural history
    - Linguistic discrepancy: cacao more as object of inquiry, milk chocolate as a transformation, processed form, commercial product
    - Cacao isn’t an indigenous Caribbean crop
        - Cacao as object of natural history
        - Cacao as commodity, crop
    - Symbol of: harm? Bitter taste; Catholic Church
    - Mixing or diffusion of knowledge
    - context of chocolate as a luxury good—> France, Spain especially

- Places
    - Peru/Mexico/Central America
    - Jamaica: plantations
    - UK
    - Northern Europe
    - France/Spain

Sloane brought back Jamaican cacao specimens to London in 1689
- Linnaeus used the engraving Sloane made of this sample to designate Theobroma cacao
- Sloane allegedly discovered that milk could be added to chocolate to make it sweet, pleasurable, Ok for british palates
- Sir Hans Sloane chocolatiers
- Different Story: ANTI “indigenous gentlemanly discovery”- Jamaica Natl Heritage Trust—> emancipation jubilee
Sloane saw illustrations as key in his discovery/history of species
- Collaborative transatlantic process of knowledge transfer
    - Needed both live, preserved specimens to transfer knowledge & plants from jamaica to uk


Delbourgo:
- Whole History: contexts, people, processes
    - Situating everything in context
        - Slave trade/plantation systems and economy
        - colonialism
        - Production of knowledge
- Sloane’s “sweet legacy”
- Cacao as species & Chocolate as commodity? Connection between W London & W indies: botanical science, empirical knowledge, commercial profit, colonial trade, Atlantic slavery. Who owns a plant?
- exploiting the triangular trade for knowledge and gain
    - HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
        - British colonialization, interest & capital investment increasing in Caribbean due to profitability of sugar (W African labor) and Atlantic slave trade
    - Botany combined w/ethnography. Gain intelligence about culture, etc of people as well as foreign objects and plants
- before Linnaeus!
- Sloane curious re: plants, also re: slaves & their culture
    - “both were concerned with particularity, variety, and utility”
“Collecting things necessitated collecting people. Gathering natural specimens was a direct function of the labor systems, capital investment, and plantation order driving the expansion of the imperial British economy” (77).

**** “Through the profit-driven networks operated by the slave trade, botanical circulation fostered the communication of ethnographic intelligence and lent it useful techniques of observation, description, visualization, and collection”

8 In an Atlantic world fast being remade by the slave trade, the natural history that described plants like cacao was linked to reimagining the order of man. 

So Delbourgo’s main argument is that they’re using similar techniques to observe, describe, and understand plants as they are Africans essentially
Connection between the human and the botanical
	- esp. in how we interact with plants! what can we learn
viewing plants as cultural device

“Making species public… actively produces global relations”
